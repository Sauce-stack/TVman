# One headless check, with a wall clock and an eye on what Godot actually said.
#
# A GDScript file that fails to parse does not fail the check that uses it. The scene loads without
# the script, `_ready` never runs, nothing ever calls `quit()`, and the process sits in its idle
# loop until something else kills it. The same happens when an `await` never resolves. Both read as
# a slow machine rather than as a broken check — which is exactly what they cost the first time.
#
# A runtime error is worse than either, because it does not hang. `SCRIPT ERROR` unwinds the
# function it happened in and the check carries on from the next line: every assertion below the
# error is skipped, nothing is recorded as failed, and the script reaches its own report and prints
# the pass it no longer earned. That is not a check that broke — it is a check that lied, and it
# cost a whole review to notice. So a run that logged one fails, whatever it went on to print.
#
# So: a check that has not finished in time fails, a check that never said it passed fails too, and
# a check that hit a runtime error fails even if it said it passed.
#
#   tools/run-check.sh res://tools/verify_waves.tscn      # a scene
